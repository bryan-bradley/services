# Senior IT Advisory & Mentoring

_Second-opinion guidance for technology leaders navigating high-risk decisions_

---

## What this is

I offer a limited amount of **paid advisory and mentoring work** for IT leaders.

This is **not** consulting, staff augmentation, or fractional executive work.  
My role is to provide **candid second opinions**, **decision support**, and **leadership guidance** — without operational responsibility.

---

## Who this is for

This is typically useful for:

- CIOs, CTOs, and senior IT leaders  
- Founders or executives facing technology decisions with real risk  
- Leaders who want an experienced second set of eyes before committing  
- Technical managers stepping into executive-facing roles  

---

## What I help with

Common topics include:

- “Are we about to make a mistake?” decisions  
- Vendor selection and contract sanity checks  
- Build vs buy tradeoffs  
- Cloud vs on-prem realities  
- Legacy modernization planning  
- Untangling fragile or high-risk systems  
- Executive communication and leadership judgment  

---

## What I do **not** do

To be explicit, I do **not**:

- Take on operational or delivery responsibility  
- Manage staff or projects  
- Provide on-call or urgent support  
- Do hands-on implementation or coding  
- Serve as a fractional or interim CIO  

---

## How engagements work

Engagements are intentionally **structured and time-bounded**:

- One-off advisory sessions (60 or 90 minutes)  
- Monthly mentoring (one call per month)  
- Clear decision or topic focus  
- Payment arranged in advance  

Availability is intentionally limited.
